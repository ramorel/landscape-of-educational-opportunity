# Opp-App: A Shiny app documenting the landscape of educational opportunity in the United States

A work in progress :)

Schools and school districts vary widely in the resources available to them and the outcomes they produce. It is no secret that the education in the United States is marked by stark inequalities in access to resources and opportunities. 

The purpose of this project is to give an easy-to-access snapshot of the educational opportunity provided by each public school district in the United States. Right now, the information provide is relatively simple and straightforward, but I plan to extent it to include more nuanced models. In particular, I aim to implement models that estimate deviations from predicted outcoms, given characteristics of the district.
